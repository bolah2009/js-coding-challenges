## Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bolah2009/coding-challenges.git

```

- Install Dependencies (For linter)

```bash
yarn install
```

To run ESLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
yarn lint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
yarn lint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
yarn format:check
